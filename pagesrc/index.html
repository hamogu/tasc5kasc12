<h2><span>Rationale</span></h2>
<div class="c12 row">
<p>Asteroseismology has brought about a revolution in our understanding 
of stars and their interiors, yielding profound new insights into 
stellar evolution, Galactic archeology, and exoplanet-host stars. The 
greatest advances have been enabled by near-continuous photometry from 
space-based missions, such as CoRoT, Kepler, and now the Transiting 
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TASC5/KASC12 will be the first 
meeting where participants have the opportunity to present analysis and 
results from asteroseismology and precision stellar astrophysics of 
objects in the southern ecliptic observed by TESS. The workshop will 
emphasize the most recent results from TESS, but will also highlight new 
results from existing data from the Kepler and K2 missions; the joint 
meeting is the 5th workshop of the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium 
and the 12th workshop of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium. 
TESS is an MIT-led NASA mission, and the workshop will be held from 
22-26 July 2019 on the MIT campus in Cambridge, USA. It is unique in 
that it will immediately precede the first TESS Science Conference, also 
held at MIT starting 29 July 2019.</p>

<h2><span>Privacy Policy</span></h2>
<div class="c12 row">
<p>The organizers of this conference limit the collection of information about you unless
you explicitly provide it to us in a form, e.g. when submitting an abstract. Our server logs the IP addresses of all visitors; these logs are frequently overwritten.
However, we link to forms and websites operated by other entities and cannot
control how they collect and process information; so please check their privacy
policies.</p>

<p>Abstract submission is handled through Google forms; we collect only the data
necessary to evaluate abstracts, and inform you about the conference (such as
announcing when abstracts are selected, or contact authors not yet registered
close to the deadline), and prepare the conference program. The conference
program, including author names, institutions and abstracts for all accepted contributions, will be made public. Your data is stored on
Google's servers and on personal computers of the LOC in the USA. Your submitted information will be shared with
the SOC to allow them to select talks and posters for this conference. Google
may store additional information (like your IP address) when you access Google
forms, but we do not have control of or access to that data. Google's policies are
at <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS">http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS</a>. Similarly,
conference registration and payment is handled through MIT conference
services; check their privacy policy before you enter data. They will provide
personal information that you entered in the registration form (but not the
payment form) to the LOC. We will use this to contact you about the conference,
print badges, and make a list of registered participants (name and affiliation)
public and perform other tasks required to organize the conference.</p>

<p>We want to make you aware for your rights:</p>

<ul class="listing">
<li>The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>

<li>The right to rectification – You have the right to request that the LOC correct
any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request
that the LOC completes the information you believe is incomplete. However,
changes to your abstract submission after the deadline may disqualify your
abstract from being accepted.</li>

<li>The right to erasure – You have the right to request that the LOC erase your
personal data, but if you do so, your work cannot be presented at the
  conference and you may not be able to attend as a registered participant. We
  may be required to keep some your data to process any refunds.</li>

<li>The right to restrict or object to processing – You have the right to request that the LOC
restricts the processing of your personal data. However, this may disqualify
your abstract from being accepted or prevent you from attending the conference
  as a registered participant.</li>

<li>The right to data portability – You have the right to request that the LOC transfers the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like
to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our
email: <a href="mailto:tasc5@mit.edu">tasc5@mit.edu</a>, call us at
+16172538008 and write to Hans Moritz Guenther, MIT Kavli Institute for
Astrophysics and Space Research, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, NE83-557, Cambridge,
MA 02139, USA.</p>

<p>The LOC keeps its privacy policy under regular review and places any updates
  on this web page. This privacy policy was last updated on 18 March 2019.</p>
