Dear {{dat['First author']}},

we have processed your abstract so that you can see how it will be
presented to the SOC and how it will look on our website. Please check
it is correctly formatted. You might have to save the html to a file
and open it as a file in a webbrowser as some email programs don't
render the mathematical formulas correctly.

If you want to change your contribution, you can simply edit it with
the link in the initial confirmation email. We will send you another
message like this after every change.  Although the link will continue
to work, the SOC many not accept changes made after the deadline.

Common reasons why your abstract might not format correctly:

- Formulas should be written like this: $0.3\; M_\odot$.

If you need assistance or notice a problem with this message, please
contact the Moritz Günther <hgunther@mit.edu>. (Moritz Günther will
not pass on any personally identifylable information to the SOC to
protect the annonymous review of astracts.)

Looking forward to seeing you at TASC5/KASC12!

Yours,
   Moritz
